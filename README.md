# Personal-Man-Page
This project involves creating a personal man page. The goal is to document my knowledge as a computer scientist to avoid complexity. I have learned the hard way that debugging can take hours if not done properly. Not knowing the basic debugging process or commands adds further unnecessary complexity. This in turn wastes time and resources.

*A software philosophy text file is also uploaded to the repo. This is to remind myself of better practices when writing software.

The primary sources of wasted time includes
- recalling commands (this includes gdb commands for debugging)
- effective debugging techniques (use of gdb etc)

I may add to this list as I try to mitigate complexity in the workflow as a computer scientist
