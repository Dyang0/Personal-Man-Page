# Personal-Man-Page
This project involves creating a personal man page. The goal is to document my knowledge as a computer scientist to avoid wasting time looking up basic ideas.

The primary sources of wasted time includes
- recalling commands (this includes gdb commands for debugging)
- effective debugging techniques (use of gdb etc)

*I have learned the hard way that debugging can take hours if not done properly. Not knowing the basic debugging process or commands adds further unnecessary complexity.
