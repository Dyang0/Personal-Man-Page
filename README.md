# Writing-My-Own-Software-Ebook

My Intentions
- For now, I want this to be a learning experience where I can reinforce my knowledge as a software developer and aspiring pen tester
- I am involving myself with pen testing and CTFs which requires knowledge of effective techniques. I thought this would be a great opportunity to reinforce those ideas
- This project will constantly be updated as I grow more experienced as a software developer and pen tester

## Title: 

Avoiding Complexity: A Jump Start Guide for Every Software Developer

## Introduction: 

Complexity
- the state or quality of being intricate or complicated

This project involves creating my own Ebook about software. The goal is to document my knowledge as a software developer and aspiring pen tester in order to avoid complexity. I have learned the hard way that programming tasks (such as debugging) can take hours if not done properly. Specifically, not knowing the basic debugging process or commands adds further unnecessary complexity. This in turn wastes time and resources. Therefore, the goal of this Ebook is to jump start developers so they can focus on what truly matters.

The sentiment behind this Ebook is to combat our tendency to feed into bad habits. Unless you are a well versed software developer with many years in the job force, we tend to be okay with what works- although there are tools or resources to make life easier. I want to expose developers to those tools or resources so they don't waste time. 

Bad Habits + Ignorance = Complexity = Wasted Time & Resources

The primary sources of wasted time includes
- recalling commands (this includes gdb commands for debugging)
- effective debugging (use of gdb extensions, formatting, etc)

*I may add to this list in the future

## Recalling Commands
cat 
- 

ls -la
- ls: Lists directory contents
- l: Uses the long listing format. This provides detailed information about each file and directory, including permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and timestamp of last modification.
- a: Lists all entries, including hidden files (those starting with a dot).

pwd
- print working directory
